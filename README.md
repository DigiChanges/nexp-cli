# Nexp-cli [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url]

> This CLI is made to be able to quickly create the NExp boilerplate with all the content you want it to have.
> 
> It allows you to choose between Mongoose, TypeORM and MikroORM when it comes to database persistence. In addition you can also choose between Koa and Express for the HTTP library.
> 
> This tool allows you to use NExp without the need to modify the code.
